                <h2>Pride and Prejudice</h2>
                <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.</p>
        
                <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>

                <h2>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</h2>
                <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains. Never was this truth more plain than during the recent attacks at Netherfield Park, in which a household of eighteen was slaughtered and consumed by a horde of the living dead.</p>
        
                <p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is occupied again?”</p>
