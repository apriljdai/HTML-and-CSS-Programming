Using the HTML below, do the following

1.	For the first part, make the image float to the left of the text.
2.	For the second part, make the two columns of text float side-by-side. Add a border to the class "second-part" and make sure the border goes all the way around both columns of text by using the clearfix, or another technique.

first part:

<html>
    <head>
        <title>A parade of floats</title>
        <!-- Put your CSS here -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        
        <!-- Part 1: Make the image float to the left of the text --> 
        <div class="first-part">
            <img src="http://placekitten.com/125/125" />
            <p>You can use <a href="http://www.placekitten.com">placekitten.com</a> for all your placeholder image and/or cat-therapy needs! You can even get placeholder images of different sizes. It's really quite amazing.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, try making this image float to the left of this text, so these paragraphs wrap around it. <strong>Stare at the kitty if you get frustrated</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Pride and Prejudice</h2>
                <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.</p>
        
                <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
        
                <p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,'' said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”</p>

                <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains. Never was this truth more plain than during the recent attacks at Netherfield Park, in which a household of eighteen was slaughtered and consumed by a horde of the living dead.</p>
        
                <p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is occupied again?”</p>
