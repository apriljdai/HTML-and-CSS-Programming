Paste the HTML below into a new HTML file. Then, create a "css" folder with a "styles.css" file inside.

Hint: Need some help? Keep reading. There's some starter CSS in the tab below. Also, these are the CSS rules you'll need to write:

Write a CSS rule for the "realname" class that makes the color "#333333"
Make the "username" class gray and not bold
Make the "maintext" class a font size of 18 pixels
Make the "mention" class (which is a link that mentions another Twitter user) bold
Make the "date" class gray
Make all the links have the color "#008AB9"
Make all of the text Arial or another sans-serif font
