Using the fade skills you've learned, let's make a simple before and after graphic.

Copy the jQuery snippet below and paste it in script.js. Change it so that when you click the image on the page, it disappears, leaving only the background image showing.

jQuery(document).ready(function() {
        
    // Write your jQuery command after this line ...
    
    jQuery("___").___(function() {
         jQuery("___").___();            
    });
    
    // ... but before this line 
    
    /*
    
    Here is an example:
    
    When I click on the paragraph,
        the paragraph will become hidden

    jQuery("p").click(function() {
         jQuery("p").hide();            
    });
    
    */
    
});


1.	Find the jQuery folder in your Dropbox.
2.	Open up index.html and styles.css in your text editor
3.	Create your JavaScript file. In the "js" folder within the "jQuery" folder, create a file called "script.js"
4.	Search for jQuery. Google "jquery google", click on the first link, and copy the HTML snippet that looks like this: <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
5.	Paste that snippet in index.html in your <head>
6.	Add http: before the // in that snippet
7.	Include your JavaScript file. In index.html, type this on a new line to include the JavaScript file on your page: <script type="text/javascript" src="js/script.js"></script>
