Let's take the HTML and CSS you created from the last Twitter exercise, and start refining the design. Open up those files, and let's get rolling!

1.	Let's start by updating the HTML: Enclose the contents of each tweet on your HTML Page within a <div> with a class of "tweet" (see below for an example -- but don't just copy and paste it, or it won't work!).
2.	Change the margin of each paragraph to be 5 pixels on each side
3.	Make the width of each image be 430 pixels
4.	Make the width of each tweet 430 pixels
5.	Give each tweet 10 pixels of padding on each side
6.	Add a 1-pixel solid gray border to the bottom of each tweet
